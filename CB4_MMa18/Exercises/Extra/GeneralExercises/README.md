Exercises – C# Stream
1. Write a C# program that takes two numbers as input and perform an operation (+, -, *, x, /) on them and displays the result of that operation.
> Input first number: 20
> Input operation: - 
> Input second number: 12
> 20 - 12 = 8

2. Write a C# program that takes the radius of a circle as input and calculate the perimeter and area of the circle.
> Input the radius of the circle:
> 12
> Perimeter of Circle: 75.36

3. Write a C# program that takes the radius of a sphere as input and calculate and display the surface and volume of the sphere.
> Radius: 2 
> 50.26548
> 33.51032

4. Write a C# program that takes a character as input and check the input (lowercase) is a vowel, a digit, or any other symbol.
> Input a symbol: a
> It's a lowercase vowel.

5. Write a C# program that takes two numbers as input and returns true or false when both numbers are even or odd.
6. Write a C# program that takes a decimal number as input and displays its equivalent in binary form.
7. Write a C# Sharp program to display certain values of the function x=y^2+2y+1 (using integer numbers for y, ranging from -5 to +5).
